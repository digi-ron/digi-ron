# Ronnie's Github

Hi there, if you've made it to this page, welcome to my github repo. In here is nothing super fancy or anything, just a small collection of things I worked on over the years. I've added some info below if you'd like to know what stuff I work on or where else on the wide interwebs you can find me:

## Favoured Tech
generally I try to tie my own 'curiosity' projects in with the same technology I have used in previous jobs, therefore a lot of the repos in here contain one of:
- Batchfile
- PowerShell
- React Typescript (SPFx)
- Node.js (usually with TypeScript installed)

I also dabble with AutoHotKey, but a lot of that comes down to one 1000+ line script I kept building onto since the Windows 7 days, nothing work related

## Interests
Outside of work, I can usually be found messing around with:
- PowerShell (again)
- C# (only as far as super basic C# Winforms apps)
- TrueNAS
- PC Repairs
- Data-Hoarding excercises

## Where am I?
This account isn't super active as the last 2 jobs I've had have required enterprise sign-in, which I'd prefer not to tie my main github account to, so I wouldn't be waiting with baited breath for a lot of repos to show up, I usually just upload any offcuts that:
1. doesn't affect my contractual obligations, and;
2. might help someone else

## Beer Fund
If you like anything I've published on here, I have a beer fund. Donate, don't, up to you, I just added it because I'm shameless
