# Ronnie's Github

Hi there, if you've made here by accident or on purpose, welcome to my GitHub page, a quiet place containing just a small collection of things I worked on over the years. I've added some info below if you'd like to know what stuff I work on or where else on the wide interwebs you can find me:

| Color | Legend |
| ------- | ----- |
| ðŸŸ¢ | know it, lived it, loved it |
| ðŸŸ¡ | like it, learning some of it |
| ðŸŸ  | it exists, I know *just* enough to slide through |
| ðŸ”´ | if you ask me questions about it... why? |
| âšª | work related |
| ðŸ”µ | hobby/for fun |

## Favoured Tech
generally I try to tie my own 'curiosity' projects in with the same technology I have used in previous jobs, therefore a lot of the repos in here contain one of:
| âš« | Tech |
| ----- | ----- |
| ðŸŸ¢âšªðŸ”µ | PowerShell |
| ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”µ | AutoHotKey |
| ðŸŸ¡âšª | React Typescript (SPFx) |
| ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”µ | Node.js (usually with TypeScript) |
| ðŸŸ âšª | Ruby/Jekyll (Github Pages) |
| ðŸŸ âšªðŸ”µ | C# (simple desktop apps) |
| ðŸŸ âšª | Batchfile |
| ðŸŸ ðŸ”µ | Python |
| ðŸ”´ðŸ”µ | Bash script (very rarely) |

I've also been known to work with:

ðŸ”µ TrueNAS Core Management and related Data-Hoarding exercises

ðŸ”µ PC Repairs (I was a technician in a past life)

ðŸ”µ Information gathering and 3D modelling of parts for a 1999-2002 Ford Falcon AU

## Where am I?
This account isn't super active as the last 2 jobs I've had have required enterprise sign-in, which I'd prefer not to tie my main github account to, so I wouldn't be waiting with baited breath for a lot of repos to show up, I usually just upload any offcuts that:
1. don't affect my contractual obligations
2. might help someone else, and;
3. could look good to a recruiter or HR department

I am still around on other platforms as much as can be expected, take a look at my side pane for anywhere else I am

## Beer Fund
If you like anything I've published on here, I have a beer fund. Donate, don't, up to you, I mostly added it on a friends recommendation.
