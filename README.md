# Ronnie's Github

Hi there, if you've made here by accident or on purpose, welcome to my GitHub page, a quiet place containing just a small collection of things I worked on over the years. I've added some info below if you'd like to know what stuff I work on or where else on the wide interwebs you can find me:

| Color | Legend |
| ------- | ----- |
| 🟢 | know it, lived it, loved it |
| 🟡 | like it, learning some of it |
| 🟠 | it exists, I know *just* enough to slide through |
| 🔴 | if you ask me questions about it... why? |
| ⚪ | work related |
| 🔵 | hobby/for fun |

## Favoured Tech
Generally I try to tie my own 'curiosity' projects in with the same technology I have used in previous jobs, therefore a lot of the repos in here contain one of:
| ⚫ | Tech | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 🟢⚪🔵 | PowerShell | |
| 🟡🔵 | AutoHotKey | |
| 🟡⚪ | React Typescript | SPFx Components |
| 🟡🔵 | Node.js | Usually with Typescript installed |
| 🟡⚪🔵 | C# | .NET Framework Winforms & ASP.NET Framework, .NET Core/6/8 WPF & ASP.NET Core |
| 🟠⚪ | Ruby/Jekyll | Github Pages |
| 🟠⚪ | Batchfile | |
| 🟠🔵 | Python | |
| 🔴🔵 | Bash script | Very Rarely |

## Products and Ecosystems
As is inevitable for developers, I've become the official S.M.E (Subject Matter Expert) for a couple of larger products. These tend to influence choices in what I develop as I'll try to stick to either what I know or what could be tangentally beneficial, which include:

| ⚫ | Product/Ecosystem | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 🟢⚪ | Microsoft 365 | SharePoint Online and Power Platform focused with the occasional Azure solution |
| 🟡⚪ | Optimizely CMS | |
| 🟡⚪ | Umbraco | |
| 🟡🔵 | Docker | Primarily custom apps for TrueNAS Scale and images to be run under a Windows host |
| 🟡🔵 | TrueNAS | Most recently Scale but ran a Core server for 4 years prior |
| 🟠⚪🔵 | FAMP/LAMP | Scattered through the last decade but easy enough to come back to |
| 🔴⚪ | Salesforce | Usually limited to calling it as an external data source |

I've also been known to work with:

🔵 PC Repairs (I was a technician in a past life)

🔵 Information gathering and 3D modelling of parts for a 1999-2002 Ford Falcon AU ([passion project](https://digi-ron.github.io/AU-Falcon-SPUD-Project/))

## Where am I?
This account isn't as active as it could be. The last 2 jobs I've had have required enterprise sign-in, which I'd prefer not to tie my main github account to. This account is my personal one, and I only publish any offcuts that:
1. don't affect my contractual obligations
2. might help someone else, and;
3. could look good to a Recruiter/HR department/Hiring Manager

I am still around on other platforms as much as can be expected, take a look at my side pane for anywhere else I am
